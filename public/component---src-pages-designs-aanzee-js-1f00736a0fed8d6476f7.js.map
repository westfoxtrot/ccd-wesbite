The design went through several iterations before holding a group buy in November of 2018 with an estimated ship date of March 2019.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>With this board I aimed to create a board with a subtle signature that was easily recognisable. To this aim I’ve got a few unique features. First off I have a straight line at the front and back of the board accented by the plate itself stepping through the sides of the case.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>In the original design this was designed to be Blue with a brass plate to accent, hence the name which is Dutch for “on sea”</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I’ve also included a slight slope raise of height between the front and the back of the board to surround the caps a little more, higher at the back than at the front. It’s 7mm at the front and 9mm at the back. It’s a small difference but, for me, it creates a unique structure to the board.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>I worked closely with a designer to come up with a slightly fresher feel for the board, changing the font used from the prototype and changing the logo to a completely new design, I’m really happy with the work she did and have to give her a huge shout out here: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/morganadalmeida\">Morgana on Twitter</a></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>This has been a very well received board which makes me very happy. One purchaser wants it noted that this board is used to write advanced code for ARM</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</section>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</Layout>\n)\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/1-8daa878447b2bfb04028b7dea06877db.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
